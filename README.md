pdf2markdown
======================

## Usage
A script that converts (ppt-like) pdf to markdown style text with headers and bullet points. 

The first line on each page is by default the header. Lines broken up due to a narrow column are merged. Special characters at the beginning of lines, if any, are converted to bullet points ("-").

## Instructions:

It can be run with two options:
### 1. automatic output: 
- enter filename, (password), skip unwanted lines if they contain specific characters (e.g., page label "3 / 10", name of the presenter),  and whether you want to modify the text formatting. It then outputs the processed result for the entire pdf file.
### 2. manual specification: 
- enter the parameters above for each page, check output, and continue to next page if you're satisfied with the output.

## Example output:

##### The somatic motor system controls skeletal muscles 
Output systems of the nervous system
 - (somatic) motor system: controls contraction of skeletal muscles, enables movements
 - autonomic nervous system: controls contraction of smooth and cardiac muscles, regulates function of inner organs
Neural centers responsible for movement 4 distinct but interactive subsystems for motor control
1. Spinal cord and brainstem circuits
- Reflexive or voluntary movement (“final common path”)
- Coordination between different muscle groups, even with isolated spinal cord
2. Upper motor neurons
- Cell bodies in brainstem or cortex, synapses to local circuit neurons or lower motor neurons
- Cortex: Initiation of voluntary movements, complex spatio-temporal sequences of skilled movements
- Brainstem: regulation of muscle tone, orienting 3-4 Basal ganglia and cerebellum
- No direct access to local circuit neurons or lower motor neurons
- Cerebellum: attenuation of motor error (real-time and long-term)
- Basal ganglia: movement initiation
